Business Problem: Identifying Low-Risk Aircraft for Expansion into the Aviation Industry
## Background
Our company is diversifying its portfolio and is looking to expand into the aviation industry by purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises. However, the aviation industry involves substantial risks, especially when it comes to aircraft safety. To make informed decisions, the company needs to understand the potential risks associated with different aircraft models to avoid costly accidents and reputation damage.

The goal is to evaluate various aircraft models based on historical accident data, identify the safest options, and provide actionable insights for selecting the best aircraft to purchase.

# Objective
We will analyze a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) containing aviation accident records from 1962 to 2023. From this data, ww will determine which aircraft models have the lowest risk in terms of accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries. These insights will then inform the decision on which aircraft to purchase for the companyâ€™s expansion into the aviation business.
